## Session notes (Ticket 02)
- Built: migrations/0001_init.sql (all contract tables), src/slots.ts (generator, guarded hold, availability list), tests on a real local D1.
- Contract change (owner's instruction): one calendar; calls and sessions never overlap; enforced in the hold write. Added to CONTRACT.md Data section.
- Hold is one conditional INSERT ... ON CONFLICT; expiry by hold_until, no cron; a replay is refused as ALREADY_HOLDING.
- Slot rows exist only once held or booked (the generator is the source of available times). Booking (HELD -> BOOKED) comes in Ticket 04/06.
- Test helper added: miniflare 4.20260730.0 (dev only), pinned. The 5.x alpha bundled with wrangler has an incompatible options API.
  `npm audit` reports 3 high advisories in its dev-only tree (sharp, undici); nothing ships in the Worker.
- Checks (local and GitHub Actions on PR 2): typecheck, vitest 20/20, gitleaks, wrangler dry-run: all passed.
- Credits: not visible to Claude; check the Usage page.
- Open questions: none.
- Next: Ticket 03 (WhatsApp bot), after Rohit merges PR 2.

## Session notes (Ticket 01)
- Checks (local and GitHub Actions on PR 1): typecheck, vitest 10/10, gitleaks (no leaks), wrangler deploy --dry-run: all passed.
- Cashfree KYC left unticked (owner said dashboard live, Payment Links activation unconfirmed).
- Credits: not visible from inside the session; check the Usage page.
- Open questions: none.
- Next: Ticket 02 (Data + slots), after Rohit merges PR 1.
